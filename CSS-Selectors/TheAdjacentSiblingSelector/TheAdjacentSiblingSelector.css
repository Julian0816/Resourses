/*We used the adjacent sibling selector to change the second and third paragraph to red. 
This seems very tricky, doesnâ€™t it? Instinctively, we would expect the first paragraph to be red as well.
After all, the first paragraph is on the same level as the next two, and, has siblings.

However, this selector only applies to elements that are preceded by something else. 
In this instance, only the paragraphs preceded directly by a sibling paragraph will be targeted.

The first paragraph in the list is preceded by the div, so it remains unchanged.*/
